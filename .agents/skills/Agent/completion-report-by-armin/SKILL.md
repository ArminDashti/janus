## Rules
1. **Trigger:** Execute ONLY if the task is completely finished. 
2. **Strict Structure:** Always use the exact tables and headers provided above.
3. **Valid Data:** Only report facts from the current turn. Use "None" or "N/A" if a specific table section (like Risks or MCPs) has no data, but keep the layout intact.
